# Remote control LCD display on ESP8266 with Web hits

!(img/testshot.jpg)

# Setup
1. Copy wifi\_config--example.h to wifi\_config.h and put your settings in there
2. You'll have to get your LCD working yourself.  I use a particular ILI9341 320x240 board on my ESP8266.  I designed an adapter board for it (see See also section)

* For convenience, I designed an adapter board going between the LCD and the ESP8266 [ILI9341 / TJCTM24028-SPI - ESP8266 Adapter Board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/dopTFnBT).
* The enclosure needs some work so I've not published it yet. Sorry.
